
# Caching Proxy Server


Project Overview

This project is a Caching Proxy Server designed to enhance web performance by caching frequently accessed resources, reducing load on origin servers, and speeding up content delivery to end-users. Proxy servers act as intermediaries between clients and servers, and by introducing caching, this server aims to minimize latency and improve efficiency for repeated requests.

Key Features

Caching Mechanism: Stores responses from origin servers and serves cached content for repeated requests, reducing load and latency.
Request Handling: Supports HTTP request forwarding and caching based on response headers.
Cache Expiry and Eviction: Implements policies to remove stale or infrequently accessed items from the cache, ensuring efficient memory usage.
Concurrency: Designed to handle multiple requests concurrently, improving throughput.

Architecture and Design

Proxy Layer: Intercepts client requests and checks for cached responses.
Cache Storage: Stores HTTP responses with metadata for quick retrieval.
Cache Control Policies:
TTL (Time-To-Live): Defines cache expiry based on specified time.
LRU (Least Recently Used): Evicts the least recently accessed items when cache reaches capacity.
Concurrency Handling: Uses multi-threading to handle multiple client requests efficiently.

Getting Started

Prerequisites
C++17 or later
CMake for building the project
Boost (optional) for networking and concurrency support

Installation

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone git@github.com:SricharanReddyVanguru/CachingProxyServer.git
cd CachingProxyServer
Build the Project:

bash
Copy code
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
Run the Server:

After building, start the caching proxy server with:
bash
Copy code
./proxy_server


Usage

Configure the server settings in the provided configuration file (if applicable) for cache size, TTL, and other parameters.
Direct client applications or browsers to use the proxy server’s IP and port.
Monitor logs for cache hits, misses, and evictions to optimize caching policies.
Example
To test the server, point your web browser or a tool like curl to use the proxy server:

bash
Copy code
curl -x http://localhost:8080 http://example.com

Future Enhancements

Dynamic Cache Size Adjustment: Automatically adjust cache size based on load.
Advanced Cache Policies: Implement additional policies like LFU (Least Frequently Used).
HTTPS Support: Add SSL/TLS encryption to secure connections.
